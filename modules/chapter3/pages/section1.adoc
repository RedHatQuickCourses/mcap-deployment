== Prerequisites

Ensure you have already executed *_setup_hypervisor.yaml_* playbook from `Initial Setup on the Hypervisor` page.

== SNO VMs Deployment

You can either use the *_setup_sno.yaml_* playbook to create QCOW2 image for `sno` VMs and then deploy `sno` VMs on the hypervisor.

Ensure you are in *_ansible_* directory of the repo.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ansible-playbook playbooks/setup_sno.yaml -vvv | tee -a /tmp/setup_sno.log
----

The above command results in verbose play output.
`tee -a` command redirects the output to `/tmp/setup_sno.log` log file.
In case of failure, `/tmp/setup_sno.log` log file can be used for troubleshooting the issue.
