= Network Settings
:experimental:

In this section, you will be configuring additional network settings needed for deploying _Tenant_ cluster.

After you install the Kubernetes NMState Operator, you can configure a Linux bridge network for live migration or external access to virtual machines (VMs).

[IMPORTANT]
====
In this POC setup, there is only one bridge, `virbr0` and each SNO VM has single NIC.
This NIC is used to deploy _Infrastructure_ SNO cluster on SNO VMs.
As NIC is already used for deploying _Infrastructure_ SNO cluster, NMState configuration will not work using the same NIC.

For example, two NICs are attached to SNO VMs (connected to the same bridge `virbr0`) at the time of creating SNO VMs.
In this case, deployment of _Infrastructure_ cluster from _Hub_ cluster using RHACM will not proceed.
The reason behind this is that the two NICs are on the same network.

Ideally, there should be separate networks for _Infrastructure_ and _Tenant_ clusters.
It is possible that in future releases or updates of this course, the separate network configurations may be included.

There is a workaround to address it in this POC setup, adding the second NIC to SNO VMs after the deployment of the SNO cluster.

== Prerequisites

. Verify that _sno1_ cluster is deployed successfully.

. Access the _sno1_ cluster via CLI and web console.

. Ensure that `sno1.lab.example.com` node is in `Ready` status and that all cluster operators are available.
+
.Sample output:
----
[root@hypervisor ~]# oc get nodes

NAME                   STATUS   ROLES                         AGE   VERSION
sno1.lab.example.com   Ready    control-plane,master,worker   23h   v1.29.7+4510e9c

[root@hypervisor ~]# oc get clusterversion

NAME      VERSION   AVAILABLE   PROGRESSING   SINCE   STATUS
version   4.16.8    True        False         23h     Cluster version is 4.16.8
----

. Ensure that NMState operator is installed on _sno1_ cluster.

== Add Additional Network Interface Card (NIC) to `sno1`, `sno2` and `sno3` VMs

To reduce the network complexity in POC setup, add the second NIC to SNO VMs at this point.

. In `sno1` VM configuration, click btn:[Add hardware].
+
image::sno1_add_nic.png[]

. Add network interface.
+
Select menu:Network source[Bridge device...].
+
Device name: `virbr0`.
+
Click btn:[Finish] to add NIC.
+

. Notice, NIC is added on the fly.

== Configure NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy

You can create a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP)` manifest for a Linux bridge network.

. Access the `sno1` cluster's web console.
+
From the left navigation pane, click menu:Networking[NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy].
+
image::sno1_console_nncp.png[]

. To create the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP)`, click menu:Create[From Form].
+
image::sno1_console_nncp_1.png[]

. Create the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP)`.
+
Policy name: `br0-policy`.
+
image::sno1_console_nncp_2.png[]
+
Interface name: `br0`.
+
Type: `Bridge`.
+
Check box the `IPv4` and select `DHCP` in `IP configuration`.
+
Port: `enp2s0`.
+
This is the NIC, which you added in the previous section.
+
image::sno1_console_nncp_3.png[]
+
Click btn:[Create] to create the `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (NNCP)`.
+
image::sno1_console_nncp_4.png[]

. Verify that the `Enactment states` of the `br0-policy` is `Available`.
+

== Configure NetworkAttachmentDefinitions

You can create a `NetworkAttachmentDefinitions (NAD)` to provide layer-2 networking to pods and virtual machines by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

A Linux bridge network attachment definition is the most efficient method for connecting a virtual machine to a VLAN.

. Access the `sno1` cluster's web console.
+
From the left navigation pane, click menu:Networking[NetworkAttachmentDefinitions].
+
image::sno1_console_nad.png[]

. To create the `NetworkAttachmentDefinitions (NAD)`, click btn:[Create Network Attachment Definition].
+
image::sno1_console_nad_1.png[]

. Create the `NetworkAttachmentDefinitions (NAD)`.
+
Bridge name: `br0`.
+
Click btn:[Create] to create the `NetworkAttachmentDefinitions (NAD)`.
+
image::sno1_console_nad_2.png[]

. Verify that the `NetworkAttachmentDefinitions (NAD)` is created successfully.

== Network Settings on `sno2` and `sno3` Clusters

. Follow the same prerequisites from the previous section for `sno2` and `sno3` clusters.
. Follow the same steps from the previous section for configuring network settings on the `sno2` and `sno3` clusters.
