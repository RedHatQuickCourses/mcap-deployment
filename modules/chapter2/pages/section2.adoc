Click btn:[Generate Discovery ISO].
+
image::console_redhat_host_add.png[]

. Download the discovery ISO.
+
To download the discovery ISO on your laptop or desktop, click btn:[Download Discovery ISO].
In this case, you need to copy it to hypervisor manually.
+
or
+
Use `Command to download the ISO` option and run the given `wget` command to download the discovery ISO in `/var/lib/libvirt/images/` on hypervisor.
+
image::console_redhat_discovery_iso_download.png[]
+
[NOTE]
You will need `virt-manager` to attach this discovery ISO to `hub` VM.
To access the GUI of hypervisor, you will need console access.

. Access the vnc console of hypervisor.
+
[NOTE]
`tigervnc-server` is installed on the hypervisor.
Using vnc viewer, you can access the console of hypervisor.

.. Set password for vncserver.
You will use this password to access vnc console of hypervisor from your laptop/desktop.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vncpasswd
----
+
.Sample output:
----
Password:
Verify:
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n
A view-only password is not used
----
+
It is recommended to set a strong password.

.. Run the `vncserver` command to create a virtual desktop that you can view or control remotely using a VNC viewer.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
vncserver

.Sample output:
----
WARNING: vncserver has been replaced by a systemd unit and is now considered deprecated and removed in upstream.
Please read /usr/share/doc/tigervnc/HOWTO.md for more information.
xauth:  file /root/.Xauthority does not exist

New 'hypervisor:2 (root)' desktop is hypervisor:2

Creating default startup script /root/.vnc/xstartup
Creating default config /root/.vnc/config
Starting applications specified in /root/.vnc/xstartup
Log file is /root/.vnc/hypervisor:2.log
----
+
[NOTE]
As per above output, you will mention `<hypervisor_ip_address>:2` as connection in VNC viewer.

..  Download and install VNC viewer from https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/ as per your laptop or desktop operating system.

.. Use the `<hypervisor_ip_address>:2` as connection in VNC viewer.
+
image::vnc_connect.png[]

.. Click btn:[Continue] to proceed.
+
image::vnc_connection_server.png[]

.. Enter the vncserver password set by you.
+
image::vnc_authenticate_server.png[]

.. Now, you can see the console with a Firefox browser and terminal open.
+
image::vnc_viewer_screen.png[]

[NOTE]
You will not be able to drag the browser or terminal window, as there is no menu bar.

.. Get the menu bar to ease the movement of the browser and terminal window.
+
Click in terminal space.
Hit kbd:[enter] button, till you see the `[root@hypervisor images]#` command line.
+
Run `gnome-kiosk &` command in terminal.
+
image::vnc_gnome_kiosk.png[]
+
This command provides those missing menu bars.
+
image::vnc_menu_bar.png[]
+
Running the command in background i.e. with `&` allows you to run other commands on same terminal later.

.. Move the menu bar and place and resize the browser and terminal window when convenient.
+
image::vnc_menu_bar_1.png[]

. Attach the downloaded discovery iso to `hub` VM.

.. Run the `virt-manager &` command on terminal to launch virtual machine manager.
+
image::vnc_virt_manager.png[]
+
[NOTE]
You may need to close the first instance of `virt-manager` and re-run `virt-manager &` command to get virtual machine manager with menu bar.
+
image::vnc_virt_manager_1.png[]

.. First, open the console of the `hub` VM and then shutdown the `hub` VM.
+

+
image::console_redhat_pending_user_actions.png[]
+
This means you need to disconnect the discovery ISO from the `hub` VM and boot the `hub` VM from disk.

.. You can notice the user config is applied from the `hub` VM's console.
+
image::hub_vm_6.png[]

.. Shutdown the `hub` VM.
+
image::hub_vm_7.png[]

.. Change the boot order and start the `hub` VM.
+
