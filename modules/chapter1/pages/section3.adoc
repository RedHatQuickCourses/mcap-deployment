Ensure you have already executed *_setup_hypervisor.yaml_* playbook from `Initial Setup on the Hypervisor` page.

== Storage VM Deployment

You can either use the *_setup_storage.yaml_* playbook to create QCOW2 image for `storage` VM and then deploy `storage` VM on the hypervisor.

Ensure you are in *_ansible_* directory of the repo.
