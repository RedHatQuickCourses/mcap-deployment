= Initial Setup on Hypervisor

[NOTE]
You can refer to the appendix at the end for manual configuration instructions without automation.

Before proceeding with the actual MCAP deployment, let's first ensure that the initial setup and configuration are done on the hypervisor.
You will need to perform a few tasks before the actual deployment of OpenShift clusters.
Few of the tasks are automated with the help of ansible playbooks.

== Prerequisites

. Download the `rhel-9.4-x86_64-kvm.qcow2` image from the https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/rhel[Red Hat Customer Portal,window=read-later] to your laptop/desktop.

. Use secured copy (scp) to copy the `rhel-9.4-x86_64-kvm.qcow2` image from your laptop/desktop to the hypervisor and then place it in `/root` directory.

.Sample output:
----
[user@laptop]$ scp Downloads/rhel-9.4-x86_64-kvm.qcow2 lab-user@14X.XX.YY.Z:.

[user@laptop]$ ssh lab-user@14X.XX.YY.Z

[lab-user@hypervisor ~]$ sudo su -

[root@hypervisor ~]# mv /home/lab-user/rhel-9.4-x86_64-kvm.qcow2 /root/rhel-9.4-x86_64-kvm.qcow2
----

. Install `ansible-core` package on the hypervisor.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
dnf install -y ansible-core
----

. Clone the repo which holds all automation scripts and ansible playbooks.
+
[NOTE]
Clone the repo in case it is not already cloned while provisioning.
+
.Sample output:
----
[root@hypervisor ~]# ls
mcap-deployment-files
----
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
git clone https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/mcap-deployment-files.git
----

. Install the required ansible collections needed for running the playbooks.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
cd mcap-deployment-files/src/ansible/
----
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
----

== Setup and Configuration

You can either use the *_setup_hypervisor.yaml_* playbook to install packages, configure swap, LV, DHCP, HTTP, and DNS, or else run commands manually on the hypervisor.

Ensure you are in *_ansible_* directory of the repo.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
ansible-playbook playbooks/setup_hypervisor.yaml -vvv | tee -a /tmp/setup_hypervisor.log
----

The above command results in verbose play output.
`tee -a` command redirects the output to `/tmp/setup_hypervisor.log` log file.
In case of failure, `/tmp/setup_hypervisor.log` log file can be used for troubleshooting the issue.
