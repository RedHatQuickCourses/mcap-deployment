= MCAP Setup in RHDP Lab

== Overview

MCAP is a solution for managing mission-critical applications.
Mission-critical applications are software applications essential to an organization or enterprise.
If these applications fail, it can have a catastrophic effect on the whole organization.
For more on mission-critical application failure, see the real-life examples in Getting to Know Mission Critical Applications.

With Red Hat MCAP, organizations can prioritize the applications most important to their individual needs.

The MCAP solution combines the following Red Hat products:

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)

* Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization (OCP Virt)

* Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)

* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)

* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS)

* Red Hat OpenShift GitOps

== RHDP Lab Environment

[NOTE]
This setup is a Proof of Concept (POC).
This setup is not recommended for Production use cases.
For other architecture options, refer to the https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/nested-openshift-using-openshift-virtualization[Nested OpenShift using OpenShift Virtualization,window=read-later] post on the Red Hat Blog.

The following Red Hat products are used in this MCAP solution:

* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)

* Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization (OCP Virt)

* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)

=== Hardware and Bare Metal

In this lab, Equinix bare-metal is used.
The flavor i.e. server configuration is https://deploy.equinix.com/product/bare-metal/servers/[n3.xlarge.x86,window=read-later].

=== Kernel-based Virtual Machines (KVM)

In this MCAP solution, five Virtual Machines (VMs) are needed.

* One virtual machine as shared storage for _Tenant_ cluster.
* One virtual machine as _Hub_ cluster.
* Three virtual machines as _Infrastructure_ clusters.

[NOTE]
https://linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page[Linux-KVM,window=read-later]

=== Utility and Services

The bare metal is acting as hypervisor, http server, dhcp server and dns server.
Configure all these services on the bare metal.

=== Networking

In this example there are three Infrastructure clusters.
This setup uses KVMs as the base infrastructure.
All external communication between your clusters will happen via a https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/10/22/introduction-to-linux-interfaces-for-virtual-networking#bridge[virtual bridge,window=read-later] on the bare metal.

Install the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator.html[Kubernetes NMState Operator,window=read-later] on the _Infrastructure_ clusters.
NMstate operator allows users to configure various network interface types, DNS and routing on cluster nodes.
Two main object types drive the configuration.

* NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (Policy)
* NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment (Enactment)

In this lab setup, configure the NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy (Policy) and NetworkAttachmentDefinition (Object) to connect the _Tenant_ cluster.

=== Storage

Non-volatile Memory Express (NVMe) disks are attached to this hypervisor.
In this lab setup, use https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_and_managing_logical_volumes/index[LVM,window=read-later] to configure storage.

[NOTE]
Non-volatile Memory Express (NVMe) is an interface that allows host software utility to communicate with solid state drives.

On the hypervisor, first create 7TB (3.5TB + 3.5TB disks) logical volume (LV) and mount on storage pool directory path.
This stores VMs images.

There is a separate storage virtual machine (VM) for shared storage for _Tenant_ cluster.
Create three disks each of 2TB from the 7TB LV and attach it to the storage VM.
These disks are needed in Ceph deployment on storage VM.

Next, install https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.16/html/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation_architecture/openshift_data_foundation_operators[OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) operator,window=read-later] on the _Infrastructure_ clusters.
Create an OpenShift Data Foundation cluster for https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/4.16/html/deploying_openshift_data_foundation_in_external_mode/deploy-openshift-data-foundation-using-red-hat-ceph-storage#creating-an-openshift-data-foundation-cluster-service-for-external-storage_ceph-external[external Ceph storage system,window=read-later].
This is the backend shared storage for _Tenant_ cluster.

=== Hub Cluster

The main role of _Hub_ cluster is to deploy _Infrastructure_ clusters and _Tenant_ cluster.

Deploy _Hub_ cluster as https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/installing/installing_sno/install-sno-installing-sno.html[Single Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster,window=read-later].

Install following operators on _Hub_ cluster which acts as hub cluster.

* Multi cluster engine
* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)
* Logical Volume Manager Storage (LVMS)

Ensure https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.11/html-single/clusters/index#enable-cim[Provisioning and Central Infrastructure Management (CIM),window=read-later] services are deployed on _Hub_ cluster.

=== Infrastructure Cluster

The main role of _Infrastructure_ clusters is to deploy Nested OpenShift VMs using OpenShift Virtualization.
Each _Infrastructure_ cluster has one virtual machine that acts as OpenShift node in _Tenant_ cluster.

There are three _Infrastructure_ clusters.
Deploy _Infrastructure_ clusters as _Single Node OpenShift (SNO)_ cluster from _Hub_ cluster using RHACM.

Install https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/virt/about_virt/about-virt.html[OpenShift Virtualization,window=read-later], OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) and NMState operators on _Infrastructure_ clusters.

Upload discovery ISO to all _Infrastructure_ clusters to boot the _Tenant_ cluster nodes from discovery ISO.

=== Tenant Cluster

There is only one _Tenant_ cluster.
Deploy _Tenant_ cluster as https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/release_notes/ocp-4-5-release-notes.html#ocp-4-5-three-node-bare-metal-deployments[_Three-Node OpenShift Compact_ cluster,window=read-later] from _Hub_ cluster using RHACM.
These three nodes are the virtual machines running on _Infrastructure_ clusters.

All applications and workloads are running on _Tenant_ cluster nodes.
